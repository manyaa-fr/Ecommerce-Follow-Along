# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

# Milestone 1: 
Initialized README.md

-- 

# Milestone 2:

This milestone focuses on setting up the project structure, building the frontend with React, configuring styling with Tailwind CSS, and developing the login page.

## Project Folder Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

*   `frontend`: Contains all the code for the user interface (what the user sees).
*   `backend`: Contains the server-side code (what handles data and logic).

e-commerce-app/
├── frontend/
│   ├── ... (React app files)
└── backend/
├── ... (Node.js server files)


### React Frontend Setup
A new React application was created in the `frontend` directory.  React is used to build a dynamic and interactive user interface.

### Node.js Backend Setup
A basic Node.js server was set up in the `backend` directory.  This server will be used later to connect to a database and handle API requests.

### Tailwind CSS Configuration
Tailwind CSS was integrated into the project for styling.  Tailwind CSS makes it easy to create modern and responsive designs using pre-defined utility classes.

### Login Page Development
The first user interface component, the login page, was developed. This page allows users to enter their credentials to access the application.  The login page was styled using Tailwind CSS.

  - `models/`: Defines the database schemas and models.
  - `middlewares/`: (Future use) For adding middleware functions.
  - `utils/`: (Future use) For utility functions and helpers.

### Server Setup
- Initialized a Node.js server using Express.
- Configured the server to listen on port `3000`.
- Set up basic API routes for testing the server.

### Database Connection
- Integrated MongoDB using Mongoose for efficient data storage.
- Established a connection between the server and MongoDB.
- Created a basic schema for products to prepare for future data storage.

### Error Handling

# Milestone 5: Frontend UI for User Registration and Form Validation 🎯

## Learning Goals 🎯
By the end of this milestone, you will:

1. **Create the Frontend UI for User Registration**: Design a user-friendly sign-up page where users can enter their details to create an account.
2. **Ensure Proper Form Validation**: Implement validation to ensure that user inputs (like email and password) are correct and meet the necessary criteria before submission.
3. **Update the README File**: Document your progress and what you have accomplished in this milestone.

---

## What’s a Sign-Up Page? 💻

The **Sign-Up page** is a crucial part of any web application where users can enter their details to create an account. It typically includes fields like:

- **Name**
- **Email**
- **Password**

This page allows users to provide their personal information, which will then be sent to the server for processing. A clean and well-designed sign-up form is essential for a good user experience.

---

## What is Form Validation? ✅

**Form Validation** ensures that the information users provide is correct and in the right format before being submitted to the server. For example:

- **Email Validation**: Ensures the email is in the correct format (e.g., user@example.com).
- **Password Validation**: Ensures the password meets specific security criteria (e.g., minimum length, mix of letters and numbers).

Form validation prevents errors, improves the overall user experience, and ensures that only clean, valid data is sent to the backend for further processing.

---

## Steps for Milestone 5 📝

In this milestone, you will focus on the **frontend** side of the application with guidance from your mentor. The steps include:

1. **Building the Sign-Up Page**:
   - Use **HTML** and **CSS** to create a clean and simple sign-up page with the following fields:
     - Name
     - Email
     - Password

2. **Adding Form Validation**:
   - Implement client-side validation to ensure that:
     - The email is in the correct format.
     - The password meets the required length and security criteria.
     - Proper error messages are shown if the user submits invalid data.

---

## How to Set Up and Run the Project 🚀

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone the repository to your local machine to start working on the frontend.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - If there are any frontend dependencies, install them using your preferred package manager (e.g., npm, yarn).

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Open the project folder in your code editor.
   - Open the HTML file to view the Sign-Up page in a web browser.

# Milestone 6: Encrypting Passwords and Storing User Data Securely 🔐

## Learning Goals 🎯
By the end of this milestone, you will:

1. **Understand how to encrypt passwords** before saving them in the database.
2. **Know how to securely store complete user data** in the database, ensuring that sensitive information like passwords remains protected.

---

## Why Encrypting Passwords? 🔑

Encrypting passwords is crucial for protecting user data and ensuring privacy. Here are the key reasons why it’s important:

- **Protect User Data**: Encryption helps safeguard passwords if the database is ever compromised by hackers.
- **Privacy**: Ensures that user passwords are not visible to anyone, even system administrators.
- **Compliance**: Follows important security laws and standards like **GDPR** and **PCI-DSS**, which require proper handling of sensitive information.
- **Prevents Password Theft**: Encrypted passwords cannot be easily stolen, guessed, or used in unauthorized access attempts.

---

## Steps for Milestone 6 📝

In this milestone, you will focus on **encrypting passwords** and **storing user data securely**. Here’s what we’ll cover in the live coding session:

### 1. **Encrypt the Password**
   - Use **bcrypt** to hash the user’s password during the sign-up process.
   - Store the **hashed password** in the database, ensuring that the password is never saved in plain text.

### 2. **Store Complete User Data Securely**
   - Save all the user's data, such as **name**, **email**, etc., in the database.
   - Ensure that only the **hashed password** is stored while protecting the rest of the user’s sensitive information.

---

## How to Set Up and Run the Project 🚀

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone the repository to your local machine to begin working on the backend.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install **bcrypt** and any other required dependencies using your package manager (e.g., npm or yarn).

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Start your server and test the registration process to ensure that passwords are encrypted before they’re saved.

---

## Future Improvements 🔮

- Implement password verification when users log in, using bcrypt to compare the hashed password.
- Integrate token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to provide secure user login and access control.
- Add additional data validation and security measures for storing user data.

--

# Milestone 7: User Login Backend 🚀  

 *Learning Goals*  
- Validate user credentials during login.  
- Compare encrypted passwords securely.  

 *Why Encrypt Passwords?* 
- *Security*: Protects user data if the database is compromised.  
- *Privacy*: Prevents storing passwords in plain text.  
- *Compliance*: Meets security standards (GDPR, PCI-DSS).  
- *Prevention*: Makes password theft harder with hashing.  

 *How Login Authentication Works*  
1. *User Inputs Credentials* → Email/username & password.  
2. *Fetch User Data* → Check if the user exists in the database.  
3. *Validate Password* → Use bcrypt to hash & compare with stored hash.  

   *Steps to Implement*  
1. *Create Login Endpoint* → Accept email/username & password.  
2. *Retrieve User* → Fetch user data from the database.  
3. *Verify Password* → Hash input & compare with stored hash.  

 *Note:* Passwords are hashed (not decrypted). We compare hashes for authentication.
