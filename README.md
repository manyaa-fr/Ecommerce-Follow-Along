# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

## Milestone 1: 
Initialized README.md

## Milestone 2:

This milestone focuses on setting up the project structure, building the frontend with React, configuring styling with Tailwind CSS, and developing the login page.

## Project Folder Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

*   `frontend`: Contains all the code for the user interface (what the user sees).
*   `backend`: Contains the server-side code (what handles data and logic).

e-commerce-app/
├── frontend/
│   ├── ... (React app files)
└── backend/
├── ... (Node.js server files)


### React Frontend Setup
A new React application was created in the `frontend` directory.  React is used to build a dynamic and interactive user interface.

### Node.js Backend Setup
A basic Node.js server was set up in the `backend` directory.  This server will be used later to connect to a database and handle API requests.

### Tailwind CSS Configuration
Tailwind CSS was integrated into the project for styling.  Tailwind CSS makes it easy to create modern and responsive designs using pre-defined utility classes.

### Login Page Development
The first user interface component, the login page, was developed. This page allows users to enter their credentials to access the application.  The login page was styled using Tailwind CSS.
